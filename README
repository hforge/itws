Based on iKaaro
===============

ITWS is a built on top of `iKaaro`_. It adds features to help communication and
ease of use.

iKaaro is a complete CMS featuring

- Multilingual contents
- Full search capabilities thanks to `Xapian`_
- Versioning of all contents and metadata
- A set of modules: agenda, forums, tracker, etc...
- A wiki which can generate ODT books (using lpOD project libraries)
- User and role management
- Flexible workflow engine
- One-click on line editing (external editor)

iKaaro (and the itools libraries) main technical characteristics are:

- `RESTFul`_ architecture
- Built around data: the object database is based on file system with data in
  its original format
- Heavy use of standards (iCal, XHTML, XML)
- Use of git as the transaction manager and versioning system
